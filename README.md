Overview


Predictive Analysis for Car Sales and Satisfaction Trends This project focuses on predictive analysis for car sales and satisfaction trends, leveraging Python to forecast critical metrics such as UnitsSold, AvgPriceUSD, and CustomerSatisfaction for the year 2025. The dataset comprises historical data across multiple years, detailing various car models, fuel types, and their respective performance metrics. The aim is to derive actionable insights into future trends using machine learning techniques.

Project Details
Implementation: The project is implemented using Python libraries such as pandas and sklearn. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where the historical data is loaded and categorical features like Model and FuelType are encoded using LabelEncoder. Independent variables such as Year, Model, and FuelType are separated from the dependent variables (UnitsSold, AvgPriceUSD, and CustomerSatisfaction) to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

Modeling: A Random Forest Regressor, known for its accuracy and robustness with both numerical and categorical data, is employed to predict each target variable. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. Once trained, the model uses inputs for 2025 to predict sales, average price, and customer satisfaction for various car models and fuel types.
